# Triangulation-Tinder-Profile

**T**riangulation **T**inder **P**rofile *(TTP)*, is a project that I hope to develop one day *(if you want to help me, [click here](https://github.com/Game-K-Hack/Triangulation-Tinder-Profile/issues/1))*, which will make it possible to constitute a database with the name, the age, a photo and its location at 1 km ready.

To know the location of a profile it would be necessary to have control of 3 Tinder profiles, to make a triangulation.

TTP will also provide a facial recognition database. This will allow you to find who you want without calling on a third party.
